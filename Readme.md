# WebNeko

# tsneko

**tsneko** is a js library which adds a neko ![neko](https://i.imgur.com/2Q9Nhj0.gif) to your website

Idea and assets stolen from [webneko.net](https://webneko.net/)

## States

## üöÄ Example

You can run a demo locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run example
```

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080 or http://localhost:8080 to see a live demo

// TODO deploy to cdn

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Usage

If you simply want to add it to your üï∏Ô∏èwebpageüï∏Ô∏è:

```html
<script src="tsneko.js"></script>
<!-- then -->
<script>
  const n = new tsneko.defaultNeko();
  let clean = tsneko.run(n, 'assets/socks');
  // some time later
  // call clean() to remove it from the document
  clean();
</script>
```

If you want to use it in your node project:

Use the node package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```bash
npm install tsneko
```

```javascript
const tsneko = require('tsneko');
let clean = tsneko.run(n, 'assets/socks');
// some time later
// call clean() to remove it from the document
clean();
```
